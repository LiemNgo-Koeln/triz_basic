The origin of invention is rooted in antiquity. Our ancestors initially used objects created by nature (e.g. rocks, sticks) for food production and protection. Therefore, the first invention used tools, materials, and methods from nature. In those days, the process of invention of our ancestors was through observation and luck (randomness). Someone would have pointed out that a sharp stone or horn could cultivate the land, or the skin of animals could be used for clothing, or burning sticks after a forest fire could be used for cooking. Shipping would most likely have started from the moment that man noticed that a log in the water could be kept afloat. Ship building dates back to the invention of the first raft. Even in ancient times, people used the waterways of rivers and seas for movement. Intense maritime business was developed in particular for slave trading. The invention of the wheel has radically changed the method of movement on land. Inventions are characteristics of many types of activities, for example in construction, architecture, literature, art, agriculture, sports. Each of these types has its own innovations. The history of innovation in the visual arts is related to their inventions, prospects, new kinds of paint, new directions, and so on. Of course, a special role is played in the invention of engineering. The word “engineer” is derived from the French word ingénieur and the Latin words ingeniare (to contrive, devise) and ingenium (cleverness) which is an innate ability, talent, intelligence. Inventors need an engineer’s ability not only in the development of innovative solutions, which are usually issued in the form of patents, but also the design, prototyping, development, mass production and manufacturing, operation and maintenance of equipment. At all stages, there are problems that require inventive solutions. In this context, we must have the relevant knowledge of the methods of invention, and the ability to use them in different situations. 2.2 1.2. Trial and error method Let us find out why a “problem solving technique” is needed. It is true that all of us solve problems every day without any techniques being used. So, why do we need some kind of “problem solving technique”? Indeed, when a well-known specialist decides to solve a problem from the field of his knowledge, then he does it quickly and professionally. This routine process is shown in Figure 1.1. Image Figure 1.1. Process of solving a known type of problem However, what if the specialist is faced with a new type of problem where he has never solved in his life? He is trying to solve it, but “meets a wall”, which appears as an insurmountable barrier (Figure 1.2). The specialist cannot get a solution because he lacks the expertise and experience. Image Figure 1.2. Process of solving an unknown type of problem Let’s see. How do we usually solve these problems in this case? In our view, problems which are more creative or inventive results in the use of brute force to derive solutions, due to the large number of options available (Figure 1.3). We try to solve the problem by moving in one direction but it does not work. We try to change the direction a little, but it still does not work. We return to the starting point and choose a different direction. Again, we try to solve the problem and fail again. And at some point, we reach the first solution point. Typically, this solution is sufficiently low level. It usually lies on the surface and is not able to be used. The problem solving process continues, reaching a second solution point which is the next error. Image Figure 1.3. Trial and error method In science, this process of enumeration of options for solving problems is called the method of “trial and error”. Solving problems through “trial and error” takes too much time, and the resulting solutions are not always the best. Conventionally, all solutions to problems can be divided into 5 levels. The first level being the lowest, and the fifth level being the highest. The higher the level of solution requires more samples to be taken. Thus, solution at the 1st level requires no more than 10 samples, while solution at the 5th level requires at least 1 million samples. Detail solutions levels described in section 2.2. Typically, using the method of “trial and error” get solutions of the 1st, less often 2nd level. Try to understand why using the method of “trial and error”, are weak solutions. An expert, solving problems, first of all, relies on his knowledge and experience. It is good when he solves the types of problems known to him. When solving fundamentally new problems, this experience suggests already known paths which do not help in this case but hinders the process. Typically, these solutions have been tried. Otherwise the problem would have been solved. Such experience does a disservice. Our memory suggests already known solutions imposed by psychological inertia. This concept is also called “inertia of thinking” or “psychological barrier”. Therefore, the psychological inertia vector is always directed towards the low-level solutions (weak solutions) i.e. solutions of the 1st and 2nd levels. When a problem is solved by the “trial and error” method, a lot of time is spent which does not always yield the best solution. Moreover, the resulting solutions are usually expensive. 2.3 1.3. Psychological inertia When we solve a new problem, we unconsciously try to use solutions, methods, or concepts which are known to us. This “obliging” memory suggest ways which were previously used by us, i.e. it makes us go on the “beaten path”. This is a phenomenon which is called psychological inertia. Thus, psychological inertia is a phenomenon in which we involuntarily use well-known solutions and methods, actions, etc., based on previous experience. It is good when known types of problems are solved for a specialist; this is a routine process. In this case, you do not need to waste time on what is known. However, if problems of new types are solved, then psychological inertia is a hindrance. There are special techniques for removal of psychological inertia. Let us describe some of the reasons for the appearance of psychological inertia: • Use of specific terms; • Parametric representation, for example, size-time representation of an object; System of values; • Use of the usual principle of operation; • Use of the usual forms; • Traditions (professional, corporate, national, territorial, religious, etc.) 2.3.1 1.3.1. Use of special terms One of the reasons for the appearance of psychological inertia is the use of familiar terms given in the conditions of the problem. We think in concepts and the terms imperceptibly “push” us in the direction of already known solutions. Example 1.1 Icebreaker Considering, for example, the problem of moving an icebreaker in ice, we involuntarily present a certain “technology” of movement in ice. “Icebreaker” means ice must be cracked. Although it may be better to cut, saw, blast or move under the ice, do you need ice or through ice? Overcoming this type of psychological inertia can be carried out by moving to more general terms or functions that are performed on these objects. Thus, it is necessary to determine the system which includes the object and define the function that is being executed on the object. This may already be sufficient to get rid of psychological inertia. It may be necessary to determine the supersystem which interacts with the system and determine its function. This process can be continued by defining the function of the supersystem, etc. Getting rid of special terms is described in ARIZ (Sec. 6.10.2). Example 1.1. Icebreaker (continued) Let us examine the term “icebreaker”. Its function is to break ice. A more general function - break ice, destroy ice. It is possible to identify all the ways of destroy ice. We already mentioned above: cut, saw, blast. Сan add, for example, melt, dissolve, and so on. Now let’s find out why we need to destroy the ice. It is in order to move ships through the ice. It is necessary to identify other ways to move through the ice. As we noted earlier, a ship can move under the ice, over the ice, into the ice, and through the ice. It is necessary for the ship to pass through the ice in order to overcome a certain space. So, we need to identify all possible ways of moving certain objects from one point to another. Thus, we can find a lot of other ways to overcome the space without psychological inertia influencing us. 2.3.2 1.3.2. Parametric representation Psychological inertia appears with the use of familiar parameters for a given system. Example 1.2. Supersonic aircraft When an aircraft speed exceeds the speed of sound, a shock wave occurs at the leading edge during the moment of transition from the sound barrier. Dramatic changes in flow properties occur abruptly where gas pressure and temperature increase abruptly at the shock wave front. All of these changes are greater with higher supersonic flow speeds. Gas temperature reaches several thousand degrees at hypersonic speeds (Mach 5 or more). For example, the space shuttle “Columbia” was destroyed on February 1, 2003 due to a damaged heat protection shell during the flight. Example 1.3. Phase change Water can turn into steam or ice by varying temperature and pressure. Similar changes may be carried out with any of the system parameters and it is desirable to choose the most significant one. To overcome this type of psychological inertia, the parameters increase from given to infinity and decrease to zero, and in some cases to minus infinity. Changing conditions to a maximum or minimum of abrupt changes often occur properties. More details about this will be discussed in Sec. 8.1.3. Psychological inertia appears to use the usual size-time concepts which are associated with a particular object or process. The dimensions of the object and duration of its actions are either explicitly stated or implied in the conditions of a problem. One way to overcome this kind of psychological inertia related to size-time and cost performances is to use STC (Size-Time-Cost) operator which is discussed in Sec. 8.1.3. In general, this kind of psychological inertia is associated with typical values of system parameters. In order to overcome this kind of psychological inertia, use the parametric operator based on maximum increase and decrease of parameter and search for new solutions. Examples are given in Sec. 8.1.3. 2.3.3 1.3.3. Tradition Tradition (professional, corporate, national, territorial, religious, etc.) has a great influence on the style of our life, on fashion, on the methods of preparing food, on the type and content of objects surrounding us, on the style of work and thinking. Let’s show some features of the national tradition. Example 1.4. The car engine Car engines manufactured by companies from different countries were presented at the exhibition. The _Frenc_h made an engine with a beautiful appearance, which was very nice to watch. To disassemble this engine, seven different tools were used. The German engine did not look as beautiful as the French engine. The body of the German engine was not as beautiful as the French. It was carefully crafted even from the inside, even where no processing was required. To disassemble it, it was necessary to use three tools. The American engine was not outwardly handsome. The casing from the inside was processed only in the necessary places. Only one tool was needed to disassemble it. Example 1.5. Flowers in the Alps Travelers are urged not to pick flowers in the Swiss Alps. The following notices are used to encourage this habit using national psychology. The inscription in French reads: “Enjoy the colors, but do not pick them!”. It sounds like a polite request in English: “Please do not pick flowers!”. The German notice is emphatic: “Flowers – don’t pluck!”. The psychological inertia of this type can be overcome by considering as many “solutions” as possible offered by other specialties, companies, countries, nationalities and religions, etc. It is necessary to use the best solutions. 2.3.4 1.3.4. System of values Value ideas about things and concepts (value system) impose their worldview on them, which prevents them from seeing in a different light. Example 1.6. Water Water is considered a free resource in countries where there are many rivers and lakes. However, every drop of water is very much appreciated in the desert. Overcoming this type of psychological inertia requires changing the idea of the existing value. To present the most valuable object as non-valuable or vice versa, non-valuable as the most valuable and to imagine the consequences of this approach. 2.3.5 1.3.5. Principle of operation Perhaps, psychological inertia manifests itself with a special tenacity in terms of maintaining the same principle of operation for new inventions. Many such examples can be seen in the history of technology. Let us recall some of them: Example 1.7. The first steamship The first steamship was built in the late 18th century by an American inventor named John Fitch. He set in motion for the elimination of oars. Rowers were replaced by a steam engine while the rest of the old ship’s principle of operation was not changed (Figure 1.4). And most importantly, the propulsion (oars) was left behind from the old vessel. Image Figure 1.4. The first steamboat Example 1.8. Walking locomotive The walking locomotive was invented by William Brunton. He used the principle of operation of a horse. The wheels were not used for propulsion. However, mechanical legs were instead used to grip the railway rails at the rear of engine; and pushed it forward (Figure 1.5). Brun received Patent no. 3700, issued May 22nd, 1813. Image Figure 1.5. Walking locomotive A functional approach is required to overcome this kind of psychological inertia. The principle of operation is chosen in order to perform the function as efficiently as possible. 2.3.6 1.3.6. Form Preservation of the old form in new inventions is one of the most common types of psychological inertia. Consider an example from the history of technology. Example 1.9. The first car The first car repeated the familiar form of carriages. The steam engine of this car was located in front of a special housing which operated in the form of a horse. Interestingly, the control of this machine remains conventional. The usual reins were used to turn the car (Figure 1.6). Image Figure 1.6. The first car A functional approach is required to overcome this kind of psychological inertia. The original structure is selected so as to perform the function and operation as efficiently as possible. However, sometimes the original structure may be due to psychological inertia of inventors who prefer the familiar which is the conventional concept of the product. This is even more common for items in “retro” style. Also, the original structures are often repeated in vogue. The methods of development of creative imagination allow us to manage this psychological inertia. 2.4 1.4. Lack of systems thinking In addition to psychological inertia, conventional thinking also gives rise to a lack of systems thinking (systemic approach). First of all, let us recall the parable. Example 1.10. The parable of the blind men A group of blind men was asked to touch one part of an elephant and asked to describe what it was (Figure 1.7). One of them touched its leg and said it was something round and thick, like a pillar. Another touched its trunk and said it was something flexible, like a snake. The third touched its tail and said it was something subtle, like a rope. The fourth touched its side and said it was like a wall. Image Figure 1.7. Blind men This is a typical example of a non-systemic thinking. Let us recall the myth of Midas. Example 1.11. Midas Dionysus was relieved to find his beloved teacher Silenus being treated very well in King Midas’ palace. Dionysus offered Midas to pick any gift as a reward. Midas exclaimed: “Oh, great god Dionysus, do so that everything that I touch, turns into pure, brilliant gold!” Midas did not think that the food and his family too, will be converted into gold. The concept of systems thinking will be discussed (Sec. 3). Conclusion Using conventional trial and error method leads to: • Unnecessarily high cost of time and money in design and manufacturing • Obtaining low level of ideas • Late inventions It is obvious that there must be more advanced techniques for producing ideas. This technique was created by the Russian scientist, Genrich Altshuller. He called it the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). 2.5 1.5. Independent work 2.5.1 1.5.1. Quiz 1.
